3.Projects
Google Cloud’s Resource Manager tool is designed to programmatically help you manage projects.
It’s an API that can gather a list of all the projects associated with an account, create new projects, update existing projects, and delete projects.
It can even recover projects that were previously deleted,and can be accessed through the RPC API and the REST API.

POLICIES
Policies can be defined at the project, folder, and organization node levels.
Policies are inherited downward.
This means that if you apply a policy to a folder, it will also apply to all of the projects within that folder.
